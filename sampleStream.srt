1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,460
foreign

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,719
maybe you'll get some audio

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
all right there it goes

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,640
no I figured I might as well go ahead

5
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,640
and start

6
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,440
dreaming these one-up plays

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,420
I don't know

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,379
if I want to do the DLCs on this little

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,379
guy but

10
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,860
I'm thinking I will

11
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,659
and if anything else the kind of time to

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,659
go ahead and do

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,240
at least one of them

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,400
interesting dialogue

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,460
I want

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,460
to get rid of my withdrawal effects

17
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,899
what can I do for you

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't know why they decided to make

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,979
this part

20
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,299
unlike the other ones where you just get

21
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,479
it removed and set it through this whole

22
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,479
screen

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,120
why am I so heavy

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,120
that's probably why

25
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,959
I need to clear out

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,280
foreign

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,990
[Music]

28
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,379
let's see

29
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,940
I want to

30
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,700
I done

31
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,080
that DLC

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,299
I won't believe him go through because

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,959
of my weight capacity so I need to toss

34
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,959
out some stuff

35
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,819
welcome sir or matt

36
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,819
oops he doesn't got nothing

37
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,060
I don't think I can actually go back to

38
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,759
the trading Outpost nope uh they'll

39
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,940
probably just shoot me right away

40
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,720
not too many places the trade

41
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,720
currently

42
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,100
haven't traded a chit in a while

43
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,180
you're looking to buy some supplies

44
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,780
hmm

45
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,080
thanks

46
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,740
I'm thinking what I'll do actually I

47
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,960
really want

48
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,800
what's my next level up

49
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,800
77

50
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,220
so I can probably just go hop something

51
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,220
out in the Wasteland or something

52
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,380
using this as my little storage

53
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,539
but I get this much lit

54
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,259
I know I never actually did start

55
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,940
I want to do

56
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,479
Benny get him activate and get him sent

57
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,479

it's the house Edge Baby the key to

111
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,060
stacking the odds in his favor or was

112
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,920
until I swiped it

113
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,380
there's more to it but we don't have the

114
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,380
time by which I mean you don't

115
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,060
flat out all stops pulled full steam

116
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,720
ahead side bets are for losers I'm

117
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,720
playing to win

118
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,959
that temp do me a favor and stay dead

119
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,959
this time eh

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,760

thank you

125
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,440
I think my melee weapon's greater than

126
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,240
zero

127
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,019
all right I can officially use the

128
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,019
street razor

129
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,459
hey

130
00:14:53,779 --> 00:15:00,560
hi there good to meet you what can I do

131
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,560
for you today

132
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,779
good question my function is to monitor

133
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,120
Mr House's Data Network and to code his

134
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:15,980
encrypted Transmissions

135
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,260
allow me to introduce myself I'm a

136
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,160
pdq-88b securatron but you can call me

137
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,160
Yes Man

138
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,240
as I understand it I used to be just

139
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,639
like all those other securitrons out on

140
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,040
the Strip but then my Nero computational

141
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,040
Matrix was completely reprogrammed

142
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,079
oh he had some help a lady friend of his

143
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,639
she said something about living in a

144
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,639
fort over in free side

145
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,839
sure Benny had me look at it a bunch of

146
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,420
times

147
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,300
it's a data storage device kind of like

148
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,639
a hollow tape but a lot more advanced as

149
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,860
for what's on it well

150
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,600
some of Mr House's data transmissions

151
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,180
made it sound like the chip could

152
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,639
upgrade his defenses somehow

153
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,279
that's just a guess though the chips are

154
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,920
proprietary format you need special

155
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,600
Hardware to read the data on it there

156
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,480
are two locations with non-standard

157
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,399
Hardware on the network the Lucky 38 and

158
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,019
an underground facility at fortification

159
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,019
Hill I'd look there

160
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,320
this is Benny's Workshop when the tops

161
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,940
got renovated he had this half of the

162
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,940
floor blocked off for his own use

163
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,279
I guess you could say it's my entire

164
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,279
world

165
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,480
oh he wants to kill Mr house and use the

166
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,699
Platinum chip to copy my neuro

167
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,759
computational Matrix on to the lucky

168
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:59,100
38's Mainframe that should give me

169
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:04,100
control over all Mr House's defenses

170
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,100
most prominently his secure trouble

171
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,540
program to be helpful and answer any

172
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,040
questions I was asked I guess nobody

173
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,620
wanted to restrict who I answer

174
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,980
questions for

175
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,980
probably pretty

176
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,000
pretty then I'd have to help you I mean

177
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,280
it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't

178
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,760
want me to but hey not my fault I can't

179
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
say no

180
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,760
thanks see you around

181
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,760
recorder

182
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,660
foreign

183
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,160
kind of annoying

184
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,160
I didn't realize my sneak was that I

185
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,859
[Music]

186
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,919
oh

187
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,620
sure he came through here in a big hurry

188
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,080
didn't even stop to say hello I think he

189
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,900
went down his secret

190
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,179
again goal number one is to eliminate Mr

191
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,400
house and install given how you're a new

192
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,380
arrival I also recommend that you get to

193
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,059
know some of the region by the time you

194
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,740
finished up all of that the legion

195
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,740
should be close to attacking Hoover Dam

196
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,260
foreign

197
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,260
hey there's the High Roller

198
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,179
the eyes of the mighty Kaiser are upon

199
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,120
you he appreciates your service and

200
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,200
bestows upon you the exceptional gift of

201
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,240
his mark

202
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,880
my lord requires Your Presence at his

203
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,620
camp at fortification Hill his Mark will

204
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,679
guarantee your safe conduct through our

205
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,480
lands incidentally it will interest you

206
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
to know that the man you seek has fled

207
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,380
the strip and is likely making haste for

208
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,380
kaisar's Camp as we speak

209
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,020
seek kaisa by way of Cottonwood Cove

210
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,500
south of Nelson the courser luculus will

211
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,460
be waiting

212
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,460
[Music]

213
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,340
thank you

214
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,020
true to kaisar

215
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,360
what in the world

216
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,100
why in the world is that thing being

217
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,360
blasted at full volume

218
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,360
hold on I have to mute

219
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
our way

220
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,460
foreign

221
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,020
I think I might be in the clear for the

222
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,020
moment

223
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,360
foreign

224
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,100
are you rich

225
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,700
the trip will take a few hours

226
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:27,140
by order of kaisar all visitors must

227
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,140
disarm and relinquish

228
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,559
alcohol and all chems including stims

229
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,559
and

230
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,020
your belongings will be returned

231
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,380
so you're the visitor I've heard some of

232
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,820
the legionaries talking about if you're

233
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,419
in the mood to

234
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,419
have a

235
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,640
give me a shout if you need it

236
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,559
I haven't had the pleasure I have

237
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,500
crossed paths with legged lenius his

238
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,960
second in command however

239
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,059
he's the best the legion has to offer or

240
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,520
so the legionaries say brood of a man

241
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:52,440
where's a fancy metal mask in a battle

242
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,059
he killed one of my pack brahmins simply

243
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,799
because it was in his way

244
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,980
I knew better than to complain about it

245
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,980
though

246
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,179
no sir

247
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,740
not at all they're my best customers as

248
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,840
long as you don't try to sell them chems

249
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,700
or alcohol they treat you fair

250
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
hell I don't even need to travel with

251
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,480
guards most of the time in Legion

252
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
territory all the bandits are dead or

253
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,900
run off

254
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,700
between having to hire protection and

255
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,500
getting slapped with taxes it's more

256
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,760
profitable to stick to Arizona and New

257
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,440
Mexico

258
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,000
but I do cross the River from time to

259
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,000
time when opportunity comes along

260
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,640
all right

261
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:40,980
that's like the thing about

262
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,360
students Legion versus like NCR it's

263
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,320
like oh don't worry about like all the

264
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,659
bands because they're not willing to

265
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,220
like go out and deal with things

266
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,900
but then it's like Allegiance like

267
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,900
overly aggressive and brutal

268
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,500
so what do you deal with

269
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,039
you're slowing down

270
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,840
what the [ __ ] truth what the [ __ ] was

271
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,980
that I've seen crippled slaves move

272
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,080
faster

273
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,299
hi good you

274
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,860
January

275
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,080
oh well I think the game just aren't

276
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,659
crashed

277
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,520
oh oh yeah that's right this area has a

278
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,960
tendency to have really long load times

279
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,940
because there's like a lot of actors

280
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,940
that don't exist when you load in

281
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,559
what's my medical ad I think

282
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,360
yeah 75 should do it for the medical

283
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,559
check is at 70.

284
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,559
waves aren't much of a challenge

285
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,179
Outsiders are a rare sight at the fort

286
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,840
step carefully around here and you might

287
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,840
just leave alive

288
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,360
it took years for Kaiser to conquer

289
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,120
lanius's tribe and kaisar showed Mercy

290
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,779
to the survivors allowing them to join

291
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,779
the legion

292
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,340
had the positions been reversed kaisar

293
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,240
would be dead

294
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:32,720
lanius is called the monster of the East

295
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,720
because he never ever shows Mercy

296
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,659
been doing it since I was a boy the

297
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,179
mongrels know to listen up when I start

298
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,480
talking to them

299
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,520
we breed them mostly but sometimes we

300
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,740
get some good ones from Denver

301
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,740
that whole city is overrun with them

302
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,140
Lupa

303
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,140
yes she's the mother of a lot of our bet

304
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,600
none may enter without Caesar's

305
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,600
permission

306
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,760
uh-huh some of the slaves have been

307
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,120
spreading stories about the burned man

308
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,120
again

309
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,000
foreign

310
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,320
if you're injured I might have healing

311
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,779
I never finished my training the legion

312
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,760
thought I do know basic first aid but

313
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,620
I've had to rely on tribal remedies to

314
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,460
treat illnesses and I'm always running

315
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,460
low on Xander

316
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,460
oh I've been using two roots for flour

317
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,460
thanks to you

318
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,080
buddy

319
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,080
a small town in New Mexico the legion

320
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,240
three years and counting if I could just

321
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:44,580
get across the river I'd be free

322
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,940
we're property if you're too young or

323
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,940
too old

324
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,600
I can only do that if you're a friend of

325
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,640
the

326
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,640
the Leggett is not a man to be crossed

327
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,020
I'm looking forward to getting sent

328
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,020
across the river

329
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,480
hold your tongue waste roll

330
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,760
the camps are getting crowded

331
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:35,299
the new slave girls are quite beautiful

332
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,260
under penalty under penalty of death The

333
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,380
Prisoner is forbidden to speak with you

334
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,380
until

335
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,140
we can talk afterwards

336
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,299
so I finally get to meet The Courier

337
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,320
who's caused so much trouble with the

338
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,320
new California Republic

339
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,039
you spread word of the massacre of

340
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,039
nipton just like wolf has asked you

341
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,019
okay

342
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:26,280
you turn Camp forlorn hope into a mass

343
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,960
grave I get it we share a common enemy

344
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,780
and now you come before the mighty

345
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,780
Kaiser to what offer your services

346
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,879
maybe I should have you struck blind so

347
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,139
my face is the last sight you ever

348
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,619
behold

349
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,619
look

350
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,260
you do know why I wanted to meet you

351
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,599
right

352
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,599
a man nearly kills you so you track him

353
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,760
across the breath of the Mojave

354
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,220
you arrive on the strip and Waltz into

355
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,960
the Lucky 38 like someone left you a key

356
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,060
under the doormat

357
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,619
you visit the tops and next thing you

358
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,140
know the head of the chairman is fleeing

359
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,060
the strip like a whimpering little pup

360
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,380
when you set your mind to something you

361
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,240
get results

362
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,920
I like that

363
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,480
the question is

364
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,480
are you ready to get started

365
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,820
I have eyes and ears everywhere it

366
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,960
behooves me not to invade the West blind

367
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,400
and deaf

368
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,320
it hasn't been hard to track your

369
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,960
progress it's not as though you've been

370
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,760
keeping a low profile the time is fast

371
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,339
approaching when my Legion will assault

372
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,380
the great dam and invade the West

373
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:49,200
before that happens I want Mr house

374
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,780
knocked out of the game a quick one-two

375
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,780
punch with you doing the punching

376
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,440
down the hill at the West edge of Camp

377
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,480
is an old building

378
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,300
it was here when the fort was taken in

379
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,880
2277.

380
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,160
inside the building is a hatch

381
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,140
and inside that hatch are two steel

382
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,300
doors that bear the Sigil of the Lucky

383
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,579
38 Casino

384
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,680
now that same sigil is on the Platinum

385
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,339
chip Penny was carrying when we captured

386
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,200
him

387
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:21,660
isn't that interesting

388
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,820
even more interesting there's a slot

389
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,579
about the same size as the chip on the

390
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,980
console that opens the hatch

391
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,680
so you know what I think

392
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,040
I think the Platinum chip opens those

393
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,079
doors doors that can't be pried open or

394
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,079
drilled open or blasted open

395
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,960
Benny's theory if I understood it

396
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,359
through all the screaming was that Mr

397
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,579
House stashed some kind of Ultimate

398
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,339
Weapon down there

399
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,400
a gigantic robot to stop us all to death

400
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:00,440
who cares whatever it is house building

401
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,440
so I want it destroyed

402
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,920
I want you to destroy whatever you find

403
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,780
in there and then I want you to come

404
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,460
back here and tell me about it

405
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,619
so go to the building and take this

406
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,540
[ __ ] Platinum chip with you my

407
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,520
legionaries will meet you there with

408
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,040
your weapons and equipment

409
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,619
talk to Benny on your way out he knows

410
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,240
I'm going to let you decide how he dies

411
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,240
maybe you want to remind him

412
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,800
they have to mute my

413
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,260
exiting because I don't have anyone lose

414
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,720
stream dick

415
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,579
rigamaroni's and my key bindings are not

416
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,119
working through the executable in full

417
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,119
screen go

418
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,079
away that we do baby that we do down to

419
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,800
brass tacks how'd your meet and greet

420
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,800
with Baldi go

421
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,420
try not to smile so wide baby you might

422
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,820
break

423
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,820
yeah Baldi said you'd get to decide

424
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,200
yeah to die in my sleep at a ripe old

425
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,480
age after a marathon session of hey hey

426
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,119
with 36 star broads

427
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,260
look I ain't a harbor for illusions I

428
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,520
ain't expecting to get out of this

429
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,200
shindig alive

430
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,660
that's why I'm trying to hand you my

431
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,660
scheme baby it's called having a legacy

432
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,680
you do that for me baby don't tease if

433
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,680
you don't mean it

434
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,359
sure Baldi wants you to go down there in

435
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,520
the bunker and Destroy whatever Mr House

436
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,599
stashed there oh you don't want to do

437
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,280
that baby

438
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,560
whatever's down in that bunker is the

439
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,780
key to the city called Vegas

440
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,820
you go down there and you use the chip

441
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,500
to do whatever Mr house would have

442
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,720
wanted you to do

443
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,119
and when you get back to the strip

444
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,480
I made it so that cat can't help but be

445
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,480
helpful

446
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,560
so you keep saying

447
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,119
the direct approach eh

448
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,079
but you should wait until the bunker is

449
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,079
taken care of she's

450
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,400
which greedy Overlord

451
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,060
Mr House hides Vegas under a skirt when

452
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,000
the bombs fall a thousand years ago so

453
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,280
it belongs to him forever you buy that

454
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,160
baby every boss has a line to explain

455
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,720
why he's special why everyone's got a

456
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,579
Vegas got a swing baby gotta have his

457
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,040
and we covered this

458
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:46,320
the only thing not bad about them is

459
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,480
they ain't Legion

460
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,760
the NCR is the biggest gang of Thieves

461
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
in the Mojave only difference is they

462
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,820
pass laws to make their crimes legal

463
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,820
before they commit them

464
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,560
the chairman

465
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,560
now you're talking that first base is

466
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,720
whatever Mr house would have you do

467
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,160
then when he ain't looking you knock him

468
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,960
out of the running and find a way to

469
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,180
take control of those securitrons of his

470
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,180
go see yes man I made it

471
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,619
nah just Spruce it up with a crucifixion

472
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,839
here and there

473
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,880
the legion is Twisted Baby original

474
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,680
losers worshiping the king of creeps

475
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,079
like he's some kind of God

476
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,079
they're worse than roaches my advice

477
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,400
I'm the most

478
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,619
now in the way back we called ourselves

479
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,140
the boot Riders silly name but that's

480
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,780
how we rode the Mojave dig we were

481
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,400
nomadic badasses not to be trifle with a

482
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,339
gang of Ruffians though with a certain

483
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,500
panache when house gave us the tops to

484
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,960
renovate his robots dropped off boxes

485
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,839
full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes

486
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,940
told us we were the chairman now

487
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,460
that caused an uproar but I said the

488
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,660
name sticks chowed the old ways baby

489
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,660
time to swing in style

490
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,780
seven years

491
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,300
took over three days after Mr House

492
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,700
introduced himself our chief at the time

493
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,339
Mountain of a guy named Bingo wanted to

494
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,740
stay nomadic I disagreed so

495
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,020
he looked so surprised when I stuck that

496
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,020
knife in his neck thought he was so

497
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,940
tough but he was so slow that's how I

498
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,119
made cheap it's how things were back

499
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,119
then

500
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,560
we were east of Vegas when the First

501
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Security we ever saw rolled up on us we

502
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,619
junked it and a minute flat the next day

503
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,560
20 roll up so we listened said we've

504
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:49,380
been selected Vegas needed us to defend

505
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,900
it in exchange we'd get cushy digs full

506
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,520
stomachs medical treatment everything in

507
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,520
Nomad never gets in other words

508
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,079
I prefer it took every stealth Boy I had

509
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,119
to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove

510
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,940
that was a close shave riding a boat

511
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,980
full of Legion boys once I was across I

512
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,619
changed into a uniform I swiped off a

513
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,540
dead legionary outside Nelson tried to

514
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:15,060
sneak into the bunker but that didn't

515
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,800
work out they found the chip

516
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,660
I wasn't going to tell them what it was

517
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,660
used for but let's just say

518
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,900
some of the slaves have been spreading

519
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,900
stories about them

520
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,619
oops

521
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,920
none may enter without

522
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,839
Kaiser has permitted your weapons to be

523
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,700
returned

524
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,700
Kaiser has put a lot of trust in you

525
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,619
hold your tongue waste true to Kaiser

526
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:57,060
well you're here this is where I wanted

527
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,099
you to end up after all I knew I could

528
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,819
rely on Caesar to give you back the

529
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,819
Platinum chip

530
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,060
was that meant to be a shocking

531
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,400
revelation of course Caesar wants it

532
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,680
destroyed he's afraid of what the bunker

533
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,960
might hold and rightly so

534
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,060
but you're not going to do that you're

535
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,119
going to

536
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,339
I don't respond well to threats

537
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,960
the Platinum chip is a data storage

538
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:27,599
device

539
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,700
I need you to manually upload the data

540
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,160
from the chip to the facility's primary

541
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,319
computer there's a terminal at the other

542
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,020
end of this facility there's a

543
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,599
complication while I can broadcast to

544
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,359
this screen I can't control any of the

545
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,240
facility systems that means I can't

546
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:46,980
deactivate its security Bots most of

547
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,540
which appear to be active according to

548
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,540
the status board I'm looking at

549
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,720
listen to me very carefully I've waited

550
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,220
too long for this moment for you to go

551
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,220
following it up on a lock

552
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,040
do as I say and your rewards will be

553
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,040
immense

554
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,079
then there will be no

555
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,420
um

556
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,160
I was in a bunch of text screens so I

557
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,280
didn't even remember that I needed to do

558
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,280
that

559
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,720
[Music]

560
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,720
yeah

561
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
foreign

562
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,480
thank you

563
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,819
foreign

564
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,880
you've carried out kaisar's will but I

565
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,880
must

566
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:16,020

execution

576
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,579
consider it the first of many

577
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,579

even know how to fight

605
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm sure you found Benny's demise

606
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,240
pleasing the destruction let's press on

607
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,059
shall we

608
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,819
as I was telling you before I want Mr

609
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:44,160
house out of the picture you have an

610
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:45,900
interest in his death too if he knows

611
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,599
that you destroyed his gadgets beneath

612
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,500
the fort you know where to find him

613
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,500
how he died

614
00:55:56,099 --> 00:56:00,839
it's called an auto dock as the name

615
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,819
suggests it's an automated physician he

616
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,020
can treat broken bones Cuts puncture

617
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:06,119
scrapes

618
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,160
makes for a powerful gift in a culture

619
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:11,480
that forbids painkillers and is largely

620
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,480
ignorant of Medical Science

621
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,240
good

622
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:18,559
don't know what kind of security he has

623
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,559
inside the Lucky 38

624
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:26,240
until Mr house has been dealt with you

625
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,240
and I have nothing to talk

626
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,680
uh I don't think it crashed I think it's

627
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:51,980
just the long loading it says a long

628
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,980
load

629
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:22,740

[Music]

636
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,220
slavery

637
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,020
but and you know this thing can move

638
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:32,240
foreign

639
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,059
wish I could have seen what's inside the

640
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:20,059
38.

641
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,280
by order of kite

642
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:52,579
I'm looking forward to getting sent

643
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,579
across the river

644
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,680

645
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,819
are you okay

646
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,599
at this point the game won the dilemmas

647
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:30,180
I said you do too much backtracking and

648
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,799
constantly going back here

649
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,160
and the whole disarming thing is kind of

650
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,160
annoying

651
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,180
it is a great honor for anyone outside

652
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,400
the legion to get it

653
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:59,040
we recently obtained an artillery weapon

654
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,079
but we don't have the

655
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:04,880
the tribe calling themselves the Boomers

656
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:04,880
is obsessed with such weapons I've been

657
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,020
he's the best warrior in the legion a

658
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,480
full legionary by the time he was 12.

659
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,920
he's never lost a battle and the leg had

660
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,260
been in command during the Battle of

661
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,520
Hoover Dam the legion would have won I

662
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,520
have no doubt about that

663
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:24,839
no legit LA News is kaisar second

664
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,460
the Leggett replaced the burned man

665
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:29,480
after the legion's defeat at the dam

666
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,480
several years ago

667
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,599
the burned man was kaizar's advisor in

668
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:40,680
general when the legion was originally

669
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,680
formed

670
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,839
the burned man led us to a disastrous on

671
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,819
kaisar's orders the burned man was

672
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:50,880
covered in Pitch by the praetorian guard

673
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:51,960
lit on fire and cast into the Grand

674
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,000
Canyon

675
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,140
kaizar has forbidden us from ever

676
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,140
speaking his true name

677
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:03,180
it's a tradition in the praetorians to

678
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,940
specialize in unarmed combat because

679
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:07,799
weapons can break or Jam however our

680
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,319
unarmed techniques favor offense over

681
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:14,119
defense we can charge the enemy and

682
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,119
flatten him with our first strike before

683
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,960
I'll answer if I can

684
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:25,079
when I was a boy the legion conquered my

685
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,780
I fought in many battles for the legion

686
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:30,619
eventually kaizar chose me to lead his

687
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,619
praetorian guard

688
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:37,640
girls and women were enslaved and many

689
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,640
of the men and boys were also choked

690
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:43,640
we were Savages

691
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,640
the legion raised us up made us

692
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:57,180
I've read Mr House's obituary

693
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:59,640
had a high opinion of himself didn't he

694
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:02,400
with Mr house out of the way I can focus

695
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:05,339
on smoothing out a few lingering

696
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,559
complications elsewhere in the Mojave

697
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:08,640
first up are the Boomers of Nellis Air

698
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:11,819
Force Base

699
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,619
a tribe so reclusive it lobs artillery

700
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:16,080
shells at anyone who comes near their

701
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:17,880
settlement I want you to offer them an

702
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,739
alliance with my Legion

703
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,920
my terms are simple

704
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:25,020
talk and they can keep their freedom

705
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,319
if you find they aren't amenable to this

706
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,319
offer

707
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,080
good your first challenge will be to

708
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:35,339
reach their settlement without getting

709
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:39,319
blown up

710
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:39,319
after that should be easy

711
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,620
hello

712
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,299

01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:17,839
this instant feeling of like a crash

714
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:17,839
occurring

02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:44,420
I have some Goods collected during my

[Music]

958
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:53,239
I'll do this last little bit and

959
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,239
probably close it up

960
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,880
foreign

961
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:25,219

962
02:05:33,619 --> 02:05:38,119
did you know the strips all stirred up

963
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:38,119
lately

964
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:02,360
humbly At Your Service

965
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,139

967
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:58,460
how may I be of service sir

968
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:09,060
my such a popular question

969
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:10,920
the white glove Society has only just

970
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:12,420
made itself known to the public of

971
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:15,300
course

972
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:17,820
where we always so refined

973
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:20,219
I'd be lying if I said yes

974
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:22,500
not everyone can wear the finest clothes

975
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:24,659
and eat the finest food

976
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:27,320
but surely we can agree that the most

977
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:27,320
tasteful

978
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:32,360
ah yes I've heard that one

979
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,619
let me hear your secrets these are great

980
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,960
yes I'm glad you asked I've heard about

981
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:51,599
you you know

982
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:53,760
I'm in a bind I've been planning an

983
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:56,960
Exquisite Society dinner he's got a

984
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:56,960
powerful and temperamental

985
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,520
yes the wrong person we scouted the

986
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:11,580
right one for weeks the heir to a

987
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:13,139
Mercantile Empire sort of a black he cut

988
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:16,380
ties with his family and left their

989
02:08:13,139 --> 02:08:19,260
estate to wander he was ideal corn fed

990
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:21,780
and well to do but no one to miss him if

991
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:24,000
he were to disappear unfortunately the

992
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:26,900
Trap my subordinate set for him failed

993
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,900
and that

994
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,400
I asked for a last minute replacement

995
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:34,619
and they stole the son of the most

996
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,199
dangerous Brahmin Baron in New Vegas

997
02:08:34,619 --> 02:08:39,900
well he stayed at this very Hotel

998
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:41,639
needless to say this could be a disaster

999
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:42,719
if things aren't put back the way they

1000
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:45,000
should be

1001
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:47,520
strictly speaking we're no longer

1002
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,560
allowed to eat people but I'm hoping the

1003
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:52,860
right person in preparation might sway

1004
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:55,500
Marjorie to see things my way

1005
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:58,139
I need a replacement and I need the boy

1006
02:08:55,500 --> 02:09:00,300
taken care of the replacement must be

1007
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:02,639
healthy and well bred

1008
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:05,099
with so little time we'll have to go

1009
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:07,679
after our original choice Carlisle

1010
02:09:05,099 --> 02:09:08,820
Sinclair he lives in a shack north of

1011
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,860
here

1012
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:12,960
if you could send him here or knock him

1013
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:15,300
out with this and drag him into the

1014
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:17,480
dumpster next to his house we can do the

1015
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:17,480
rest

not this one empty

1018
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,900
I don't believe it's seen you since

1019
02:09:25,739 --> 02:09:30,659
before the War and what would the point

1020
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:33,659
be really who would pick up his trash if

1021
02:09:30,659 --> 02:09:35,280
he used it but for our purposes it

1022
02:09:33,659 --> 02:09:39,199
should keep his body safe and hidden

1023
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,199
until my cohorts can recover it

1024
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:44,400
Ted Gunderson is his name it would be

1025
02:09:42,599 --> 02:09:46,860
simplest if we could convince him this

1026
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:48,840
was all but if he won't listen we can't

1027
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:50,699
very well let him go he'll have to be

1028
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:53,900
slaughtered and but you would need to

1029
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:53,900
deal with his father heck

1030
02:09:54,619 --> 02:09:59,520

1031
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:01,380
in our Penthouse I understand desired

1032
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:04,860
security so be careful if you go up

1033
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:08,780
there and our Mr Sinclair resides to the

1034
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:08,780
north he rarely stretched

1035
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:16,400
I assume you're joking

1036
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:24,599
no everyone he meets he tells the same

1037
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,820
story that his son disappeared from the

1038
02:10:24,599 --> 02:10:29,239
casino not from his room he'll look

1039
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:29,239
guilty

1040
02:10:29,699 --> 02:10:32,480
indeed

1041
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:48,540
I've heard the legions planning to

1042
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:50,040
unleash their best men against us where

1043
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:52,380

hello

1050
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:34,820
Welcome to the ultralux

1051
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:41,159
tell your ruler we have no interest in

1052
02:11:38,460 --> 02:11:44,099
such ties Caesar's Legion is a

1053
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:47,400
collection of unclean barbarians

1054
02:11:44,099 --> 02:11:49,619
anytime the white glove Society is

1055
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:51,420
as much as Mortimer and some of the

1056
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:54,239
other members have tried to convince me

1057
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:56,659
otherwise I will not have a scene as

1058
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:56,659

1059
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:59,719
okay

1060
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:07,920
I do but I suppose it is a labor of love

1061
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:09,840
if we at the White Glove Society are all

1062
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:12,179
responsible for maintaining the beauty

1063
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,940
and class of the ultralux

1064
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:19,099
and as its founder I suppose it falls to

1065
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:19,099
me to decide how we go about it

1066
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,900
foreign

1067
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:42,540
good day

1068
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:45,119
any word as to our arrangement

1069
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:47,880
I see

1070
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:50,099
looking to elevate his social I'll admit

1071
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:53,219
I could see benefits to living under his

1072
02:12:50,099 --> 02:12:55,280
rule certain transgress but that's

1073
02:12:53,219 --> 02:12:58,820
neither here nor there I'm afraid

1074
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:58,820
Marjorie won't have it

1075
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:12,260

a dress code there's only one rule to it

1126

that no one can be said to have dressed

1127
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:51,180
better than us

you

1130

what we're supposed to say I think

1132
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:59,280
Marjorie likes them for the mystery they

1133
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,700
create and the way they make it clear

1134
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:06,319
that we're different from everyone else

1135
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:06,319
but you didn't hear that from me

1136
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:10,819

02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:30,500
in here people will think I'm rich

1140
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:15,680
what is it says

1141
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:19,340
you've done the right thing citizen

1142
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:22,020
reporting struggles scuffles and tussles

1143
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:24,120
thanks to you we can all sleep in our

1144
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:26,160
beds a little Sounder knowing that Swift

1145
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:29,160
Justice awaits those who take moral

1146
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:31,439
shortcuts for personal gain rest assured

1147
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:33,780
I will apprehend the perpetrator and see

1148
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:36,020
him or her punished even though it's

1149
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:36,020
someone

1150
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:52,700
I'm out of here

1151
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:05,240
beg your pardon

1152
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:13,700
you're under arrest

1153
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:20,340
that's my son you're talking about he

1154
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:22,380
ain't dead I'm looking for him it is my

1155
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:24,000
duty to inform you that murder is a

1156
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:26,040
serious crime

1157
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:29,760
as a murderer you should be feeling

1158
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:32,700
emotions such as guilt sorrow and shame

1159
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,080
if not you may wish to consult a mental

1160
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:37,220
health professional

1161
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:40,020
where's my son what'd you do with my boy

1162
02:23:37,220 --> 02:23:43,020
I hope this experience has taught you an

1163
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:44,280
important lesson about the value of

1164
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:46,800
human life

1165
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:49,319
you can't do this to me this is a

1166
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:53,240
mistake please allow me to escort you to

1167
02:23:49,319 --> 02:23:53,240
the nearest criminal processing facility

1168
02:23:57,420 --> 02:24:01,760
deceased bodies are a known source of

1169
02:23:59,399 --> 02:24:01,760
illness

1170
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:31,580
with house out of the way I hope someone

1171
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:31,580
opens a lucky 38.

1172
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:42,720
any word is to our arrangement

1173
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:46,020
so the baron has slaughtered his last

1174
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:47,100
brunt how delightful he was a pox on our

1175
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:48,720
business

1176
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:50,880
he would have driven the price of beef

1177
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:53,460
down to the point where any poor wretch

1178
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:55,620
could afford it can you imagine but now

1179
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:57,899
we can price it even higher create a new

1180
02:24:55,620 --> 02:25:01,640
luxury Market not for you of course

1181
02:24:57,899 --> 02:25:01,640
you'll get a special discount

1182
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:14,939
we'll know after tonight's banquet at

1183
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:16,920
seven o'clock

1184
02:25:14,939 --> 02:25:20,340
I'll only be telling everyone what

1185
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:23,100
they've eaten after they've eaten it

1186
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:25,560
that way they will all have crossed the

1187
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:28,380
same silly taboo they'll have to

1188
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:30,840
reconsider it even Marjorie

1189
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:32,819
it's all image with her anyway

1190
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:35,540
she just needs to realize the only

1191
02:25:32,819 --> 02:25:35,540
difference between

1192
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:54,600
to think Mr but his arrest ought to

1193
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:58,859
instill faith in our patrons that

1194
02:25:54,600 --> 02:26:01,700
murderers are not welcome to gamble here

1195
02:25:58,859 --> 02:26:01,700
tell your

1196
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:17,399
ah you're back

1197
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:20,040
we'll know after tonight's banquet at

1198
02:26:17,399 --> 02:26:22,680
seven that way they will all have

1199
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:26,060
crossed the same silly taboo

1200
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:26,060
it's all image with her

1201
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:43,800
ah you're back

1202
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:46,260
we'll know after tonight's banquet at

1203
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:49,399
seven o'clock that way

1204
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:49,399
it's all image

1205
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:58,280
I'd wager that the Army's sending a leap

1206
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,359
had enough

1207
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:17,359
thank you

1208
02:27:18,319 --> 02:27:21,560
I'm here

1209
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:30,200
foreign

1210
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:13,100
[Music]

1211
02:28:09,859 --> 02:28:13,100
you're back

1212
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:18,600
I certainly did Philippe created an

1213
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:20,280
extraordinary amused bush from the Flesh

1214
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:22,859
of the Gunderson boy

1215
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:24,600
everyone at the bank would loved it I

1216
02:28:22,859 --> 02:28:27,240
told him what it was and the room was

1217
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:29,840
quiet for a moment but then we all had a

1218
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:29,840
hearty laugh

1219
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:37,439
now that it's been accepted it will

1220
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:41,240
become a regular course for us

1221
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:41,240
it's a new and exciting front

1222
02:28:42,899 --> 02:28:48,540
oh I very much doubt that then again I

1223
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:50,520
wouldn't be surprised if our Chef used

1224
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:52,859
it here and there as a secret ingredient

1225
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:55,439
to

1226
02:28:52,859 --> 02:28:57,479
I should think so but it would be I have

1227
02:28:55,439 --> 02:29:00,479
however told her how instrumental you

1228
02:28:57,479 --> 02:29:02,760
were in revolutionizing our Cuisine and

1229
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:05,280
she knows what we stand to gain from a

1230
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:08,120
ruler who supports it have a word with

1231
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:08,120
her see which

1232
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:32,479
things are getting stranger every day

1233
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:36,620
what can I get

1234
02:30:01,859 --> 02:30:07,260
you thanks

1235
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:07,260
salutations

1236
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:45,260
I've heard you have to make reservations

1237
02:30:41,399 --> 02:30:45,260
at the Gourmand years in advance

1238
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,300
ah you're back

1239
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:56,300
must do stuff

1240
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,880
welcome to the Ultra Lux

1241
02:32:04,979 --> 02:32:09,899
why it's Splendid Mortimer told me about

1242
02:32:07,859 --> 02:32:12,979
you you know what a pair of Mischief

1243
02:32:09,899 --> 02:32:12,979
Makers you two are

1244
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:19,140
but the new entrees are fresh and bold

1245
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:22,140
and I have

1246
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:24,180
I don't care for their incivility or the

1247
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:26,520
hodgepodge of sporting equipment that

1248
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:28,080
passes for fashion with them

1249
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:30,300
nevertheless

1250
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:32,160
I have heard Caesar has a stately

1251
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:34,680
dignity about him

1252
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:36,420
and I understand his policies will agree

1253
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:39,180
with our new menu

1254
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:42,060
I prefer Mr House of course but he may

1255
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:44,640
not be around forever and the NCR will

1256
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:47,180
surely set back our cuisine

1257
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,180
to

1258
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:57,140
I've heard that elite units are on the

1259
02:32:53,939 --> 02:32:57,140
way to support our armies here

1260
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:30,319
howdy come try your luck I hope it's on

1261
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:30,319
your side

1262
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:00,620
foreign

1263
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:15,979
by order of cut

1264
02:35:17,399 --> 02:35:19,939
hey

1265
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:27,859
true to kaisar

1266
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:34,700
the last time we met I believe we were

1267
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:34,700
talking about the white glove Society

1268
02:36:36,060 --> 02:36:39,720
I appreciate your concern but I'm in

1269
02:36:38,399 --> 02:36:41,580
excellent health

1270
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:43,920
and we have other matters to discuss

1271
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:47,160
have you been successful in your efforts

1272
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:48,479
to recruit the white glove Society

1273
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:50,520
good

1274
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:52,740
it will be valuable to have allies on

1275
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:56,040
the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken

1276
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:58,260
now as for your next assignment I want

1277
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:59,819
you to destroy the Mojave chapter of the

1278
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:01,859
Brotherhood of Steel

1279
02:36:59,819 --> 02:37:05,300
it's not a full-strength chapter mind

1280
02:37:01,859 --> 02:37:05,300
you the profligates

1281
02:37:09,479 --> 02:37:11,600
um

1282
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:18,080
uh yeah

1283
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:18,080
the Brotherhood

1284
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:24,740
I don't I don't know

1285
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:24,740
there have been a couple

1286
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:32,520
don't but

1287
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:35,399
just leave it alone I'm fine look for

1288
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:39,140
the brotherhood's bunker around

1289
02:37:35,399 --> 02:37:39,140
I'm going to bed we'll talk

1290
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:54,319
laid girls

1291
02:37:51,780 --> 02:37:54,319
are beautiful

1292
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:08,300
neat

1293
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:18,960
all right so probably about this finish

1294
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:21,840
up this run and I think I'll probably

1295
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:24,479
start another character that's more

1296
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:25,319
melee focused alongside the multiplayer

1297
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:26,640
mod

1298
02:38:25,319 --> 02:38:29,180
just to give something something to do

1299
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:29,180
in the afternoons

1300
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:35,240
hang up with the exit until I get out of

1301
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:35,240
this
